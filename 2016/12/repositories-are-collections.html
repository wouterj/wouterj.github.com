      <h2 id="it-all-starts-with-the-interface">
        
        
          <a href="#it-all-starts-with-the-interface" class="section-link"></a> It all starts with the Interface
        
        
      </h2>

<p>When designing your application, start with designing your interfaces. If you
like your interfaces, the implementation will probably be nice as well. In this
post, we’re going to design a collection of products. The interface first
contains some basic collection methods:</p>

<div class="language-php highlighter-shiki"></div>

<p>We can now count the number of products in the collection, get all products in
the collection and check if a product is included in the collection. Now, let’s
add two simple methods for more specific operations on this collection:</p>

<div class="language-php highlighter-shiki"></div>
    
      <h2 id="a-basic-implementation">
        
        
          <a href="#a-basic-implementation" class="section-link"></a> A Basic Implementation
        
        
      </h2>

<p>The most straight-forward way to implement collections in PHP is by using
arrays. Let’s create an array based product collection:</p>

<div class="language-php highlighter-shiki"></div>

<p>Most of the methods in the interface can be mapped to simple PHP array
methods. This repository can be defined as a service:</p>

<div class="language-yaml highlighter-shiki"></div>

<p>Then you can probably imagine how we would use this product collection in a
controller:</p>

<div class="language-php highlighter-shiki"></div>
    
      <h2 id="using-doctrine">
        
        
          <a href="#using-doctrine" class="section-link"></a> Using Doctrine
        
        
      </h2>

<p>So far, we’ve only looked at normal repositories. I hope this brought the point
across that repositories are just collections. The nice thing about
repositories is that we can implement all sort of different backends for our
collections. As this post is also about Doctrine, let’s create a product
collection based on Doctrine.</p>

<p>The <code class="highlighter-shiki">EntityRepository</code> shipped with the Doctrine ORM is a simple wrapper class
around the entity manager and the unit of work. The class isn’t used in
Doctrine itself, it’s purely an easy starting point for the users. This means
we can completely drop it and base our doctrine collection on top of the entity
manager:</p>

<div class="language-php highlighter-shiki"></div>

<p>As you can see, the code in here is just a bit more complex than using the
array repository. Even better, the usage of this repository has not changed a
single bit when comparing it with the <code class="highlighter-shiki">ArrayBasedProductRepository</code>. So we only
have to update the service definitions to use doctrine:</p>

<div class="language-yaml highlighter-shiki"></div>
    
      <h2 id="treat-repositories-as-collections">
        
        
          <a href="#treat-repositories-as-collections" class="section-link"></a> Treat Repositories as Collections
        
        
      </h2>

<p>As I tried to show in this post, treating repositories as collections has some
significant advantages:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The collection implementation is abstracted away, not much hassle with
Doctrine anymore</li>
  <li>All collection methods are located in one class/service. This means you
never has to rely on both the entity repository and manager (in order to
fetch and persist) anymore</li>
  <li>Working with Doctrine as if it’s a collection makes programming easier to
follow</li>
</ul>

<p>My last warning of this post is to not add non-collection related methods in
the repository. I sometimes see people adding <code class="highlighter-shiki">getXxxQuery()</code> methods in the
repository, as e.g. the form type requires you to set a query. These methods
tell something about the implementation. They are no longer related to
collections (try to think what this method should return in the
<code class="highlighter-shiki">ArrayBasedProductRepository</code>).</p>
    
      <h2 id="take-homes">
        
        
          <a href="#take-homes" class="section-link"></a> Take Home’s
        
        
      </h2>

<ul>
  <li>The <code class="highlighter-shiki">EntityRepository</code> class shipped by Doctrine is purely to ease usage,
it’s not mandatory at all</li>
  <li>Writing your own repositories allow you to abstract away Doctrine almost
completely from your services and controllers</li>
  <li>Repositories are just collections, please treat them as such</li>
</ul>
