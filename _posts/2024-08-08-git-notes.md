title: Store Code Discussions in Git using Git Notes
categories: article
tags: documentation

---
Code discussions contain relevant information. Isn't it a shame that we
keep these in the centralized GitHub/GitLab servers, far away from our
decentralized Git code? As soon as we move provider, we'll loose all old
discussions! And how do you ever find the pull requests back from 5
years ago? Symfony has implemented a lightweight solution to this problem
years ago using a less-known feature of Git: Git Notes.

## Git Notes?

Meet one of Git's unknown features: [Git notes][notes]. They are hard
to discover... and hard to use. Yet, they provide an interesting feature:
Adding extra information to a commit, after you've created it.

[notes]: https://git-scm.com/docs/git-notes

<aside class="side" data-type="Git garbage collection">
Git doesn't immediately remove objects after a new commit replaced them.
Often, you can still find a "deleted" commit as long as you know its hash
(even on GitHub/GitLab servers). A separate process, called [garbage
collection][git-gc], removes old unused objects. This is often run
automatically every once in a while.

[git-gc]: https://git-scm.com/docs/git-gc
</aside>

Git stores all data using immutable objects. This means that you cannot
change the objects after creation. For instance, when you change a commit's
message, Git will create a new object and remove the previous one. Git
notes are useful when you want to preserve the existing Git object, but
want to add extra data. Git notes have a many-to-one relationship with
objects: one Git object (commit) can have multiple Git notes references it.

Enough talking, let's see it in practice!

First, create a commit:

```terminal
$ git commit --allow-empty -m "Playing with Git notes"
[main a63c1ff] Playing with Git notes
 Date: Mon Jul 8 21:18:00 2024 +0200
```

Now, we can add a note to this commit using the `git notes` command:

```terminal
# 'a63c1ff' is the object (commit) to attach this note, it defaults
# to HEAD (i.e. the latest commit on the current branch)
$ git notes add -m "Extra information of this commit" a63c1ff
```

Great, we've added extra information to that commit! Now, we can view it by
using the `--notes` option:

```terminal
$ git log --notes
commit a63c1ffcf90a6ee3188a086b14eebf33087aebaa (HEAD -> main)
Author: Wouter de Jong <wouter@example.com>
Date:   Mon Jul 8 21:18:00 2024 +0200

    Playing with Git notes

Notes:
    Extra information of this commit
```

Cool! As you can see, the commit object didn't change (the hash is the same
as before), but we've attached the new note object.

### Multiple Git Notes References

By default, notes are stored in the `notes/commits` ref. But you can
categorize Git notes into multiple references, allowing you to add multiple
types of notes to a single commit.

You can use the `--ref` option to specify the note tree:

```terminal
$ git notes --ref=acceptance add -m "Tested-by: Jane doe <jane@example.com>"
$ git log --notes=acceptance
commit a63c1ffcf90a6ee3188a086b14eebf33087aebaa (HEAD -> main)
Author: Wouter de Jong <wouter@example.com>
Date:   Mon Jul 8 21:18:00 2024 +0200

    Playing with Git notes

Notes (acceptance):
    Tested-by: Jane doe <jane@example.com>
```

The `ref/notes/acceptance` now holds this new note. Using multiple
references allows us to add multiple notes to a single commit (one per
reference):

```terminal
$ git log --notes=commits --notes=acceptance
commit a63c1ffcf90a6ee3188a086b14eebf33087aebaa (HEAD -> main)
Author: Wouter de Jong <wouter@example.com>
Date:   Mon Jul 8 21:18:00 2024 +0200

    Let's use Git notes

Notes:
    Extra information for this commit

Notes (acceptance):
    Tested-by: Jane doe <jane@example.com>
```

<aside class="side" data-type="Git Notes in practise">
Git developers use notes to store references to their mailing list like
`Message-Id: <1264640755-22447-1-git-send-email-szeder@ira.uka.de>`.

You can also use notes to store other information, such as who reviewed or
tested a commit. [The reviewnotes documentation][reviewnotes] shows some
examples.

## How Symfony uses Git Notes to store GitHub Discussions

Now we know a bit about Git notes, we can look at how we can use them to
store code discussions and reviews.

Symfony maintainers use an internal CLI tool to merge contributions. Among
other things it checks CI and core team approvals, and it helps us
automatically re-target contributions to the correct version.

After merging a branch using Git, the tool also uses the GitHub API to
fetch all pull request comments. The comments are stored in a Git Note and
attached to the merge commit. This way, whenever you need to find the
discussion for a particular feature, you can look up the merge commit and
read it. Even if Symfony decides to switch to another platform one day.

### Storing GitHub Comments in a Note

First, the tool fetches the pull request comments using the [GitHub API][github-api]
via the [KnpLabs GitHub API package][knplabs]:

[github-api]: https://github.com/KnpLabs/php-github-api/
[knplabs]: https://github.com/KnpLabs/php-github-api/

```php
use GitHub\Client;

$github = new Client();
$resultPager = new ResultPager($github);

$prComments = $resultPager->fetchAll(
    $github->issues()->comments(),
    'all',
    ['symfony', 'symfony', $prNumber]
);
```

Then, it loops over all comments and puts it in a temporary file:

```php
$notes = '';
foreach ($prComments as $comment) {
    $notes .= <<<EOF
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by {$comment['user']['login']} at {$comment['created_at']}

{$comment['body']}


    EOF;
}

file_put_contents(getcwd().'/.notes', $notes);
```

Now, we can create a Git note from the file contents (Symfony puts them in
a named "github-comments" reference):

```terminal
# first, replace the local github-comments ref with the upstream one
$ git fetch origin refs/notes/github-comments:refs/notes/github-comments

# then, create the new note
$ git notes --ref=github-comments add --file=.notes
```

Finally, we can push the notes to GitHub. Git doesn't push notes by
default, we have to mention the reference explicitly:

```terminal
$ git push --no-follow-tags origin refs/notes/github-comments
```

<aside class="side" data-type="Distributed Code Reviews">
This implementation only distributes the code discussions together with the
code.

Some developers at Google took the concept one level further and created
[Git Appraise][appraise], a distributed code review implementation
(including requesting and reviewing itself).

[appraise]: https://github.com/google/git-appraise
</aside>

### Reading the Notes back

GitHub no longer shows the `refs/notes/...` objects anywhere. But as it is
just another set of objects (just like the commit tree), you can still
push and fetch it from GitHub if you reference it directly:

```terminal
$ git fetch origin refs/notes/github-comments:refs/notes/github-comments

# or fetch all note references
$ git fetch origin "refs/notes/*:refs/notes/*"
```

You can also edit the `.git/config` file of a project to always fetch
notes by default:

```diff
  [remote "origin"]
    fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*
+   fetch = +refs/notes/*:refs/notes/*
```

Now the notes exist locally, you can view them in the Git logs for instance:

```terminal
$ git log --notes=github-comments

    This is a minor. There is an option "sslmode" that is documented as an option but can be passed only in dsn query string.

    Hey!

    I see that this is your first PR. That is great! Welcome!

## Summary

* It's important to distribute more than just the code
* Use Git notes to store all sorts of important information to commits
* You can view old Symfony discussions offline by using the
  `github-comments` notes reference
