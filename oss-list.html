Want to get started contributing to open source? Or need some inspiration on
what to take up next? I've got you covered! This page is an unordered list of
feature requests and ideas that I'm excited about. However, just like you, my
time is finite...

Feel free to take an item of this list and start working on it. Don't hesitate
to message me about any of the items on this list. I would like to brainstorm
and help you contribute them (also if this is your first contribution!).

You can reach out to me on [Symfony Slack](https://symfony.com/slack) as
@wouterj, at [Mastodon](https://phpc.social/@wouterj) or directly on
[GitHub](https://github.com/wouterj).
